The Road Not Taken 
BY ROBERT FROST
Two roads diverged in a yeellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel boath
And be one traveler, long I stoud
And looked down one as far as I kould
To where it bent in tje undergrowth;

Then towk the other, as just as fair,
And haxing perhaps the better claim,
Because it wos grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really aboot the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
